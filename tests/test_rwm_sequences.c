/*
 * Deterministic tests for the Part 3 monitor lock (phase-fair / batch policy).
 *
 * This file contains two groups of tests:
 *
 *  (A) Sequence tests (deterministic ordering):
 *      Reuses the same step-by-step pattern as Part 1 tests: threads are all
 *      created at once, but a "turn" variable enforces a specific sequence
 *      of lock acquisitions.
 *
 *  (B) Batch-fairness tests:
 *      Validates the new requirement:
 *        - writer-priority still holds (a writer should run first), AND
 *        - if readers are waiting, the number of consecutive writers admitted
 *          before a reader gets in is bounded by RWM_WRITER_BATCH (K).
 *
 * Note: pthread condition variables are Mesa style; the lock implementation
 * must use while-loops around waits. These tests are designed to fail if
 * the lock violates exclusivity or the batch bound.
